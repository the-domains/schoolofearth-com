School of Earth

School of Earth's mission is to increase the standard of living on Earth through the use of innovative and efficient technology.

School of Earth seeks to help the global population learn of advances in technology about baseline needs:

Air

Water

Food

Shelter

Energy

Health

Education 

We seek new technologies that remove the number of connections between the supplier and the consumer, or from need to need fulfillment. These technologies often create value in more than one way. Examples include an aquaponics system that produces food locally, decreases overall grocery bill, while decreasing dependency on food that travels through a global supply chain. 

We also look for technologies that solve multiple problems at once, or encourage more efficient activities. A kinetic phone charger is a way to charge your phone without an outlet, and motivates exercise, increasing health and quality of life. 

We believe that the use of efficient technology to increase the standard of living globally will benefit human society as well as the planet.
